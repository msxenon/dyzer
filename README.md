## The Baseline-Aware Dart Analyzer Plugin

Dyzer is a powerful Dart plugin designed to streamline your development workflow by providing early baseline-aware support for key features. Our goal is to help you build modern, performant, and future-proof Dart applications with confidence.


## Installation

```sh
dart pub add --dev dyzer
```

## üöÄ Features

* **Baseline-Aware Support:** Dyzer helps you identify and use features that are considered "baseline" in the Dart ecosystem, ensuring your code is compatible and stable across a wide range of platforms and environments.

* **Early-Stage Integration:** Get a head start on upcoming features and APIs. Dyzer provides experimental support for new language constructs and platform capabilities, allowing you to innovate faster.

* **Enhanced Code Analysis:** The plugin integrates with the Dart Analysis Server to provide specific warnings and suggestions tailored to baseline compatibility.

## Basic configuration

Add configuration to `analysis_options.yaml` and reload IDE to allow the analyzer to discover the plugin config.

### Basic config example

```yaml title="analysis_options.yaml"
analyzer:
  plugins:
    - dyzer

dyzer:
  rules:
    - avoid-dynamic
    - avoid-passing-async-when-sync-expected
    - avoid-redundant-async
    - avoid-unnecessary-type-assertions
    - avoid-unnecessary-type-casts
    - avoid-unrelated-type-assertions
    - avoid-unused-parameters
    - avoid-nested-conditional-expressions
    - newline-before-return
    - no-boolean-literal-compare
    - no-empty-block
    - prefer-trailing-comma
    - prefer-conditional-expressions
    - no-equal-then-else
    - prefer-moving-to-variable
    - prefer-match-file-name
```

### Basic config with metrics

```yaml title="analysis_options.yaml"
analyzer:
  plugins:
    - dyzer

dyzer:
  metrics:
    cyclomatic-complexity: 20
    number-of-parameters: 4
    maximum-nesting-level: 5
  metrics-exclude:
    - test/**
  rules:
    - avoid-dynamic
    - avoid-passing-async-when-sync-expected
    - avoid-redundant-async
    - avoid-unnecessary-type-assertions
    - avoid-unnecessary-type-casts
    - avoid-unrelated-type-assertions
    - avoid-unused-parameters
    - avoid-nested-conditional-expressions
    - newline-before-return
    - no-boolean-literal-compare
    - no-empty-block

    - no-equal-then-else
    - prefer-moving-to-variable
    - prefer-match-file-name
```

## Usage

### Analyzer plugin

Dyzer can be used as a plugin for the Dart `analyzer` [package](https://pub.dev/packages/analyzer) providing additional rules. All issues produced by rules or anti-patterns will be highlighted in IDE.

Rules that marked with üõ† have auto-fixes available through the IDE context menu. VS Code example:

### CLI

The package can be used as CLI and supports multiple commands:

| Command            | Example of use                                            | Short description                                         |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| analyze            | dart run dyzer analyze lib            | Reports code metrics, rules and anti-patterns violations. |
| check-unnecessary-nullable | dart run dyzer check-unnecessary-nullable lib | Checks unnecessary nullable parameters in functions, methods, constructors. |
| check-unused-files | dart run dyzer check-unused-files lib | Checks unused \*.dart files.                              |
| check-unused-l10n  | dart run dyzer check-unused-l10n lib  | Check unused localization in \*.dart files.               |
| check-unused-code  | dart run dyzer check-unused-code lib  | Checks unused code in \*.dart files.                      |

For additional help on any of the commands, enter `dart run dyzer help <command>`

**Note:** if you're setting up dyzer for multi-package repository (a.k.a. monorepo), it'll pick up analysis_options.yaml files correctly.

You can define one analysis_options.yaml at the root file.

#### Analyze

Reports code metrics, rules and anti-patterns violations. To execute the command, run

```sh
$ dart run dyzer analyze lib
```

It will produce a result in one of the format:

- Console
- GitHub
- Codeclimate
- HTML
- JSON



#### Check unnecessary nullable parameters

Checks unnecessary nullable parameters in functions, methods, constructors. To execute the command, run

```sh
$ dart run dyzer check-unnecessary-nullable lib
```

It will produce a result in one of the format:

- Console
- JSON



#### Check unused files

Checks unused `*.dart` files. To execute the command, run

```sh
$ dart run dyzer check-unused-files lib
```

It will produce a result in one of the format:

- Console
- JSON


#### Check unused localization

Checks unused Dart class members, that encapsulates the app‚Äôs localized values.

An example of such class:

```dart
class ClassWithLocalization {
  String get title {
    return Intl.message(
      'Hello World',
      name: 'title',
      desc: 'Title for the Demo application',
      locale: localeName,
    );
  }
}
```

To execute the command, run

```sh
$ dart run dyzer check-unused-l10n lib
```

It will produce a result in one of the format:

- Console
- JSON


#### Check unused code

Checks unused code in `*.dart` files. To execute the command, run

```sh
$ dart run dyzer check-unused-code lib
```

It will produce a result in one of the format:

- Console
- JSON
